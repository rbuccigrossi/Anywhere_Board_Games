### Anywhere-Board-Games
##### Description
 
Anywhere Board Games (ABG) allows users to play board and card games on the web in real time on multiple machines (PC, Linux, iPhone, iPad, and Android). ABG runs as a stand-alone PHP app.

Unlike other gaming environments, we had a peculiar vision: projecting the main board on our table and using laptops or tablets to control our hands (with other friends joining in remotely).

ABG runs on PHP 5 and Apache (which is provided with the Windows installer). It supports flipping, stacking, rotating, rolling, and shuffling of pieces, so most board and card games are playable.

 The old home for this repository was on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boardgamearena/files/).

Note: ABG used to run as a Google+ Hangout app, but Google has retired 3rd party Hangout applications.
